                    <p>When they explored the Moon, NASAâ€™s Apollo astronauts left behind several instruments to collect geophysical data near each Apollo landing site. Your challenge is to develop an app that plots the seismic data these instruments transmitted back to Earth on an interactive 3-D globe.</p>
